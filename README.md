## Prerequisites

### 1. **Install Python**
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

3. Download ChromeDriver
You'll need ChromeDriver for the script to work with Google Chrome. ChromeDriver is required for Selenium to control Chrome.

Download ChromeDriver: You can download it directly from ChromeDriver's official page. https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads

Ensure that the version of ChromeDriver matches your installed version of Google Chrome. You can check your version of Chrome by navigating to chrome://settings/help.

4. Save Cookies (Initial Login)

Before using the automation script, you must log into Steam and AllKeyShop manually at least once and save the cookies.

For that start run_save.bat

This will:

Open the Steam login page, where you can log in manually.

Save the Steam cookies to cookies.pkl.

Open the AllKeyShop reward page, where you can log in manually and save the AllKeyShop cookies to allkeyshop_cookies.pkl.

6. Run the Automation Script
After saving the cookies, you can run the main automation script wheel.py:
or just run run_main.bat

Load the saved cookies for Steam and AllKeyShop.

Click the AllKeyShop wheel twice to spin it.

Handle the popup and send the result to the Discord webhook.
